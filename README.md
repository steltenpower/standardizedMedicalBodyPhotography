# standardizedMedicalPhotography
As doctors don't all have the same constant lighting conditions, perfect vision, memory or exact communication about it ...

(When in a poorly-lit room a doctor said after half a year (and hundreds of other patients):"looks much better", while I couldn't agree at all, I started thinking how that could be the case, and if this situation could be helped ...)

What if every hospital had the same standardized photography?
- Standardized lighting settings (every goal, skin color, etc. can need a different setting. Not limited to human-visible light)
- Standardized positioning of patient and camera
- Standardized camera settings

Would it help doctors to see changes through time? Discuss about a patient? Let smart algorithms assist the doctor in quantifying change, including detecting of new potential trouble?
